# KextUpdater
A cross-platform .NET 6 console app which updates your hackintosh's kexts (and which may update OC in future, too).


## Installation

Run `git clone https://github.com/NotARobot6969/KextUpdater` in the directory you want to download KextUpdater in. Move to the newly-created KextUpdater directory, then navigate to the project folder. (`cd .\KextUpdater\KextUpdater`). Finally, build and run the app (`dotnet build && dotnet run`).
